# Gloria's Color Picker
 An app that picks colors with different schemes

This was a do it alone project assigned in the Scrimba course.
The UI was given to us in Figma, but we were allowed to make any
changes we wanted.  All the code was my own.
The languages I used were HTML, CSS and Javascript.
Feel free to let me know what you think and any improvements
I should make.  Thanks for viewing.
